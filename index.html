        <p>It all started in 2018, says the <strong>Unbox Co.</strong> founder, 
            "this history began as we tried to build a coworking space and needed a good brand. 
            We began construction and, for countless reasons, it had to stop, we, however, had already created
            the brand that you know today... a friend who worked as a marketeer helped me to put on paper the idea of "unboxing ideas".</p>

        <center><h3><strong>The UNBOX concept was clearly <em>NOT</em> about software development</strong></h3></center>
        
        <p>The brand was initially created to be a coworking space, but it also went out to be the abstract idea of a brand for 
            some other genious business ideas:

            html como start e type, este é apenas um teste-->
                <li>a coworking space (as already especified)</li>
                <li>a maritime transportation company</li>
                <li>a clothing brand, yes, you may believe it.</li>

        </p>
        
        <p>As you can see, aside from what some would suppose, the UNBOX concept wasn't dreamt or designed because the founder 
            started a software company, it was a dream of many years before, the dream of a company that wouldn't do things just like 
            all the others, UNBOX is the dream of creating something through critical and inspired thinking.
            You can understand critical thinking by reading the following Wikipedia article, if you will:
